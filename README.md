Firmware for our ME7 Ecu

The firmware are based on rusefi open source code, in addition to our own work.

We will only use stable builds, and will not update this continious.


I have been acused a long time for a long list of things.

One of them are for selling ecus/firmware as my own work with the authors name and licence replaced.

I have waited a long time for these things to be posted public, and a few days ago it finally happened.

I have proof for every single claim to be false.
I have never sold anything of this, and not replaced header in any binary given away.


I belive in sharing benefits all, and if you just ask kindly you can use my code as you want.
I dont care about who wrote what, and think the whole mine/yours mentality belongs in the sandbox.

Below are a example of the person acusing me are the only one actually replacing the name.
The person are also selling ecus, and use this commercial.
