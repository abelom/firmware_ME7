This directory contains pre-defined configurations for popular engines.

These configurations are a convenience, not a limit.  Most engine types
can be manually configured.

In TunerStudio or rusEfi console use the "Popular Vehicles" dialog to
apply one of these presets.

See http://rusefi.com/wiki/index.php?title=Manual:Engine_Type

This folder is also used by the continuous integration testing suite.

New configurations should follow the pattern of <make>_<model>.cpp for
consistency.  A future change may rename these to <make>_<engine>.cpp
