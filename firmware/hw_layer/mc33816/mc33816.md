https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN4849.pdf is literaly a complete example of a four cylinder internal combustion engine (ICE) injector drive.


MC33816 has four independent microcores - four "threads" of execution. 

One thread has to be controlling variable frequency modulation (VFM) DC-to-DC converter, whatever it means.

Two more threads are running two banks of two injectors each.

Each injector has it's own low-side driver.
Each bank/pair of injectors share a "boosting" - i.e. high-voltage opening high-side driver, and a "holding" - i.e normal battery voltage high-side driver. (page 59)
